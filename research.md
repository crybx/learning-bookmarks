# Doing Research

## Places to Find Scientific Papers

* [Sci-Hub](http://sci-hub.io/) - Like Library Genesis, but for papers.
* [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/) - An open access electronic archive and distribution server for research articles. Funded by Cornell University Library and others.
* [A Scholarâ€™s Guide to Google](http://guides.library.harvard.edu/friendly.php?s=googleguide&gid=4877) - Research Guides at Harvard Library
* [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/schhp?hl=en&as_sdt=0,5)
* [How to Get Academic Papers for Free](http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=1404)
* [WikiProject Resource Exchange](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Resource_Exchange) - Another way to get access to paid resources for free (as long as you edit Wikipedia a little).

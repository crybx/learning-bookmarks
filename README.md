# What is this place?

The is my collection of learning related bookmarks, slowly accumulated over years.

The number of links has grown to the point where keeping them all on one page is overwhelming, so I've created topic pages. Just because I have links on any given topic doesn't mean that *every possible link* for that topic is included. I'm just one person and I don't try to find everything.

More links accumulate here for topics I personally spend time exploring, but I do try to include anything I stumble across or am sent by others. Some links may be duplicated between pages when they seem relevant to multiple topics.
